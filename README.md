Welcome to **Prometheus**, the AI model that allows you to generate DNA sequences for any creature you can imagine. Whether it‚Äôs a **pink panda**, an **elephant-sized turtle**, or a completely new lifeform from your wildest dreams, Prometheus decodes the mystery of biology and synthesizes genetic blueprints with precision.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Prometheus** is a state-of-the-art AI-powered tool that bridges the gap between imagination and reality by generating complete or partial DNA sequences for custom-designed lifeforms. By harnessing cutting-edge neural networks, evolutionary biology, and genetic data, Prometheus allows you to:

- **Generate entire genomes** for real or imaginary animals.
- **Modify specific traits** like color, size, and behavior.
- **Simulate viability** to ensure your creations can exist and thrive.
- **Customize features** by simply describing what you want in natural language.

---

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **üåê Natural Language Input**: Describe your creature using plain text, and Prometheus will transform it into a genetic blueprint. Example: "Generate the DNA for a pink panda with blue eyes."
  
- **üß¨ Complete DNA Synthesis**: Create fully detailed genomes or modify specific genes for existing species to alter features like color, size, or behavior.

- **üî¨ Real-Time Gene Editing Simulation**: Understand the viability of your creature with simulated biological systems that check for survival and adaptation in real-world conditions.

- **üí° Phenotype-Genotype Mapping**: Automatically translate phenotypic traits into the corresponding gene sequences.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Extensible API**: Connect Prometheus to advanced synthetic biology tools, CRISPR simulators, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies to get started with **Prometheus**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/Prometheus
cd prometheus
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìö Usage

You can use **Prometheus** either through the command line, in Python scripts, or as an API for your bioengineering needs.

### Example: Generate a DNA Sequence for a Pink Panda

```python
from prometheus import GenomeGenerator

# Initialize Prometheus
generator = GenomeGenerator()

# Input your desired creature
creature_description = "I want a pink panda with glowing fur and blue eyes."

# Generate the DNA sequence
dna_sequence = generator.generate(creature_description)

# Output the result
print("DNA Sequence for Pink Panda:")
print(dna_sequence)
```

This will output the complete DNA sequence for your custom pink panda!

## üìñ How It Works

Prometheus leverages a multi-step process to translate your inputs into actionable genetic blueprints:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Your description is processed to extract phenotypic traits such as species, color, size, and more.
   
2. **Phenotype-Genotype Translation**: The model maps phenotypic traits to corresponding genetic markers, identifying key genes for features like pigmentation, muscle growth, and behavior.
   
3. **DNA Synthesis**: Prometheus then synthesizes or modifies a genetic sequence using known biological data and gene-editing techniques.

4. **Viability Simulation**: The model runs a simulation to check if the generated genome is biologically viable and provides a report on possible outcomes.

## üåç Example Creatures You Can Generate

Here are a few examples of what you can create with Prometheus:

- A **neon-green lion** with enhanced night vision and bioluminescent fur.
- A **miniature elephant** that is the size of a house cat.
- A **blue-scaled dragon** with the ability to produce fire through chemical reactions in its glands.
- An **elephant-sized turtle** that moves with surprising speed.

## üí° Future Plans

- **Advanced Embryo Simulation**: Develop simulations that predict how embryos develop into fully-grown organisms.
- **Enhanced Ecosystem Integration**: Include predictive models for ecosystem impact when introducing new lifeforms.
- **Cloud-Based Prometheus API**: Allow users to generate creatures through a web interface and retrieve results via API calls.
